# Conspac Enterprises Ltd.

We sell unique food and nutritional supplements for humans and powerful ingredients for fish and animal feed.

## About

Conspac began in 1973 as a trading company featuring animal feeds such as hay and grain. Our scope gradually included fish feed, particularly krill. Recognizing its unique features and benefits have led us to focus on Antarctic krill for fish feed and human consumption. After 25 years in the industry, we understand the logistics and issues in regard to krill.
